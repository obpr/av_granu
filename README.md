Choose sounds and vidéos and build interactions between
two audio/video tracks, a sound analyse module,  
a time stresh module and a synthetizer and two step Sequencers



Step sequencers 

Two Step sequencers generating number sequence
according to . . .
A number sequence of time
A number sequence of itération
A number sequence of progressivity
A number sequence to be added or subtract

Apply the datas to . . . 
the position of the loop (4)
to the Pitch and the speed simultaneously (5)
to the speed only (5) to the pitch only (6)
to a synthetizer (see below)

$ = value, each step got a value
[=IT]
- Play all $ of time (all $ of Step sequencerT)
at each value of the general Step Sequencer (top line) ... allT $ / G $
- If it is not triggered = Play a $ of the Step sequencerT
at every $ of the general sequencer Step ... T $ / G $
[≠IT]
- Change steps on the step sequencer (s) in accordance with a fixed $ of time (1000) by default).
+ Column still on the right: go to the value gradually (1000) by default)

[%T]
- Divides time by the $ from Step Sequencer IT ... T $% IT

[/Tb/]
Receive the time of Step sequencer B

[A]
On/off

[next]
Step forward

[ø]
Reverse steps off and steps on

[><]
Send a step on two opposite values

[>>]
Move linearly on the sequence.
One step all 6.25$ (100%16 = 6.25)
if the tempo = loop lenght of the sequence%10

[O]
Turn this step mute



Selectors and modulation

Choose position(s) to the starting point of the loop
- Add value to this position(s)
- Move the postion(s) along the whole sequence
- Apply enveloppe to sound track and opacity to video layer


Gate
Set the position of the playhead where to start the playback loop

[raw]
raw data  A or B                 

[A@]
Make a loop on the fly and change position with Step sequencers

[@re]
Call back the loop made in [A@] 

*When released, read what is after the loop chronologically
or with the  [@A] mode go back where you were  
at your last [@re]

Press on, press off  (midi mod)

Lock selected source  (midi mod)

If you choose to send files triggered by  A or B or randomly with [BB](A) or[ BB1](B) the sample sent will be played at its beginning

[Trg] and [Bng]
Auto-receive On/off step and send enveloppe to
the sound selected.

[Trg]
On/off step 

[Bng]
send enveloppe to
the sound selected

[<<<]
Send on/off step and set enveloppe from sources selected in 
s&p, speed, or pitch

[ø]
Trigger the Step sequencer A or B as selected in
s&p, speed, or pitch


Audio modulations

Speed and pitch (50 = 0= stop, 75= go forward , 25= go back)
Speed only (50 = 0= stop, 75= go forward , 25= go back)
Pitch only 

Left ’s 2 columns

[bck]
Back to normal after selection released 

[O] 
Go back to normal
slider: set value

Choose data source [A], [B], [‘’a] or [‘’b]

Right’s 2 columns
Module data from the left ’s 2 columns

[44]
choose between 44100/88200 hz

[O] 
Go back to normal
slider: set  modulation value

Choose data source [A], [B], [‘’a] or [‘’b]


Time stretching until drone
Advance your number sequence, pattern, over the entire sample

Make the pattern you are making with Stepseq A or B sliding along the loop lenght more a less rapidly.
Select entry point in the sample
Select exit point
Select strecthing value

Analyse silences and attacks in the  audio signal of sampler or synthetizer
Send the values as [‘’a] or [‘’b] 
Select a source
[A]= track AV left 
[C]= upper synthetiser in purewave-synth
